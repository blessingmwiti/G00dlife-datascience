## Introduction

Generative models aim to create new data instances that resemble the training data. In this project, we use a Generative Adversarial Network to generate new images of handwritten digits.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used is the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Model Architecture

The Adversarial Network consists of two neural networks:
- **Generator**: Generates new images from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (generated by the generator).

### Generator
- **Input**: Noise vector (100-dimensional).
- **Output**: Image vector (28x28 pixels, flattened).

### Discriminator
- **Input**: Image vector (28x28 pixels, flattened).
- **Output**: Probability (real or fake).

## Training Process

1. **Load the MNIST dataset**: The images are normalized to the range [-1, 1].
2. **Initialize models**: Create instances of the generator and discriminator.
3. **Define loss and optimizers**: Use binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
4. **Training loop**:
   - Train the discriminator on real and fake images.
   - Train the generator to produce images that the discriminator classifies as real.
   - Print loss values for both networks.
   - Generate and display images every 10 epochs.

## Results

Generated images and training metrics are displayed during the training process. The final images should resemble handwritten digits.
