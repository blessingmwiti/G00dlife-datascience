        "- `Object-Oriented Programming` is a way of organizing code by thinking about objects and their interactions. It helps in creating reusable, modular, and easier-to-understand code.\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "<li><b>Objects:</b> Think of objects as things that have characteristics (attributes) and can do stuff (methods). For example, a car can have attributes like color and speed, and it can do things like drive and honk.\n",
        "<li><b>Classes:</b>Classes are like blueprints for creating objects. They define what attributes and methods an object will have. For example, you can have a class called Car that defines what a car is and what it can do.\n",
        "<li><b>Encapsulation:</b> Encapsulation is like putting things in a box. It means keeping related data and functions together inside a class so that they are easier to manage and understand. It also hides the inner workings of an object, so you only need to know how to use it, not how it works internally.\n",
        "<li><b>Inheritance:</b> Inheritance is like passing down traits from parents to children. It allows one class (the child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent class or superclass). This helps in reusing code and creating specialized versions of objects.\n",
        "<li><b>Polymorphism:</b> Polymorphism is like having many shapes but treating them all the same way. It allows different classes to be treated as if they are the same type of object. For example, you can have different types of animals (like dogs and cats) with a common method like make_sound(), but each animal makes a different sound."
