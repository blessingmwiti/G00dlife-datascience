## Introduction 

This repository is designed to guide you through the various stages of a typical data science project. It covers fundamental concepts such as data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and even deployment. Each section is accompanied by Jupyter notebooks that provide hands-on examples and exercises.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.12)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Additional libraries as needed]

### [Installation](https://github.com/swalehmwadime/G00dlife-datascience/blob/main/Contributing.md)

```bash

git clone https://github.com/swalehmwadime/G00dlife-datascience

```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
data-science-project/
|-- notebooks/
