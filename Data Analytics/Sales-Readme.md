## Project Overview
The project consists of analyzing sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Power BI. Here are some key aspects of data analysis that you can explore:
1. **Sales Performance**: Analyze overall sales performance over time to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in sales volume and revenue.
2. **Product Analysis**: Explore sales by product category, brand, or individual products to understand top sellers, revenue contribution, and product popularity.

4. **Geographical Analysis**: Analyze sales geographically to identify regions with the highest sales volumes, revenue, and growth potential.
5. **Pricing Analysis**: Analyze pricing data to understand price fluctuations, pricing strategies, and their impact on sales.
6. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Calculate CLV to understand the long-term value of customers and identify high-value customer segments.
7. **Inventory Management**: Optimize inventory levels and identify slow-moving or overstocked items based on sales data.
8. **Profitability Analysis**: Analyze profitability by product, customer segment, or sales channel to optimize revenue and costs.
